# DIA Gradient Identification Project - Claude Memory

## Project Overview
This project develops machine learning models to identify valid peptides from DIA-NN analysis of mass spectrometry data comparing different gradient speeds.

## Key Problem Definition
**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:** We are looking for **300SPD (fast gradient) peptides** that:
1. Are detected by DIA-NN at **higher FDR levels** (20%, 50%) in 300SPD data
2. Are **validated as true positives** by 30SPD (slow gradient) analysis of the same sample
3. **Failed to be detected** in 300SPD at low FDR (1%) - meaning DIA-NN was not confident enough
4. The ML model identifies which of these higher-FDR 300SPD peptides are actually real

## Data Structure
```
Ground Truth: 30SPD FDR=1% peptides (comprehensive, slow gradient analysis)
Baseline: 300SPD FDR=1% peptides (high-confidence fast gradient detections)
Test Data: 300SPD FDR=20%/50% peptides (includes lower-confidence detections)
Target: Additional 300SPD peptides that are in ground truth but not in baseline
```

## Model Goal
Identify which 300SPD higher-FDR peptides are actually true positives (validated by 30SPD) vs false positives, allowing us to recover valid peptides that DIA-NN was too conservative about in the fast gradient.

## CRITICAL METRIC DEFINITION
**ALL FDR AND PERFORMANCE METRICS MUST BE CALCULATED ON ADDITIONAL PEPTIDES ONLY**
- This project builds an additional classifier/layer on top of DIA-NN
- We do NOT care about baseline IDs from DIA-NN (these are included automatically)
- FDR calculation: False Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) **of additional peptides only**
- The baseline 1% FDR peptides are already validated by DIA-NN
- Our focus is EXCLUSIVELY on the precision and discovery of the additional peptide recovery

## Recent Progress
- Fixed FDR calculation to focus on additional peptides only (not combined baseline+additional)
- High MCC values (0.76+) are realistic because we're specifically targeting peptides that should be recoverable
- Positive rate of ~50% makes sense - many higher-FDR peptides from fast gradient are indeed valid when confirmed by slow gradient
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Ultra FDR optimization achieved **1.50% FDR** with 328 additional peptides (MS30-DIA7-5)
- Enhanced low-FDR analysis achieved **2.08% FDR** vs ultimate optimization's 20.89% FDR

## Current Optimization
**ACTIVE**: Smart hyperparameter optimization (4-8 hour runtime) testing 500+ configurations:
- Every XGBoost parameter combination with intelligent sampling
- All feature engineering strategies (with/without DIA-NN features)
- Advanced preprocessing, sampling, and calibration methods
- Target: Absolute best configuration for lowest FDR + highest peptide discovery

## Key Results Summary
| Method | FDR% | Peptides | % Increase | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Ultimate Optimization** | 20.89% | 496 | 11.31% | Best MCC balance |
| **Enhanced Low-FDR** | 2.08% | 330 | 7.52% | 10x better FDR |
| **Ultra FDR (DIA-NN)** | **1.50%** | **328** | **7.47%** | Best precision |
| **Ultra FDR (No DIA-NN)** | 2.06% | 333 | 7.59% | Sequence-only |
